#Generating Numbers
#'''Create a function generateNumbers(num) that takes in a positive number as argument and returns a list of number from 0 to that number inclusive.
Note: The function range(5) will return a list of number [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].'''

def generateNumber(num):
	m = []
	new = num + 1
	while new > 0:
		x = new - 1 #you cannot change x=new-1 into num, coz when you give num a value, it is a fixed value and cannot change in the loop
		m.append(x)
		new = new - 1
	m.reverse()
	return m
